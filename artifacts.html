				<h2>Eagle Scout Project</h2>
				<p>
				My Eagle Scout Project took two months to complete. I built a kiosk for the Armtrong Rails-to-Trails Association. This kiosk serves the purpose of informing trail-goers of the surrounding attractions or events that the Armstrong Rails-to-Trails Association are hosting. This project allowed me to felx my leadership skills and show that I am capable of planning and executing that plan. The most difficult part was getting everyone together to build and install it on the trail because most schedules dont line up too well.

				<h2>Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science Project</h2>
				<p>
				When I was in seventh grade, my science teacher urged me to participate in the annual Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science competition. The competition involved presenting a science project in front of a panel or judges and they would grade you based on your presentation of the project and how scientifically professional the project was. Looking back, I am really glad she convinced me to do this because, even though it was nerve-racking, I got first place at both regionals and the state competition. Overall, this was a great opportunity to practice my publc speaking skills and learn from some perfessionals.

				<h2>Distinguished Honor Roll</h2>
				<p>
				My highschool operated on a nine-week grading period schedule. If you are able to retain a B-grade in all of your classes, you are awarded the title of Distinguished Honor Roll on your report card. I cannot remember a time when I did not recieve this ranking and that is something I pride myself on. I care an aweful lot about my grades and make sure I keep a high GPA.
