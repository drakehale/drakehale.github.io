						Hi, I'm Drake Hale. I am a Senior at Armstrong Junior Senior High School located in Kittanning, Pennsylvania. My interests include fashion, business, and visual arts. My plans for after High School include going to college for business and liberal arts. One day I would like to open up a store that sells clothes including a brand that I create.
